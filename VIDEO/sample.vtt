00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.300
It is a period of civil war.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.300
Rebel spaceships, striking from

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.300
a hidden base, have won their

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.300
first victory against the

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.300
evil galactic empire.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.300
During the battle, rebel spies

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.300
managed to steal secret plans

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.300
to the empire's ultimate weapon,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.300
the death star, an armored space

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.300
station with enough power to

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.300
destroy an entire planet.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.300
Pursued by the empire's sinister

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.500
agents, princess leia races home

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.300
board her starship, custodian of

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.300
the stolen plans that can save

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.300
her people and restore freedom

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.300
to the galaxy...
